House interior:  

Early morning, just after dawn.     

Close in on a wide planked floor.     

An old wooden chair is pushed across the planks. A small girl, not more than 9 years old moves the chair in front of a window. She clambers onto it.

A vast prairie covered in snow, seen from behind a pane of glass. The glass is frosted. The girl rubs it with the sleeve of her sweater. We see her face in reflection, not very distinctly.     



Extreme close-up:     

As she breathes, her breaths render the glass more and more opaque.

The girl begins to make snow angels, falling backwards, arms spread. The snow angels are linked quite methodically, hand to hand.

The girl falls back to make the seventh snow angel. She lies on her back. She watches the fog of her breath escaping her lips.

The girl's face She senses something. She stops breathing and listens intently.     



Cut to:     

We see the girl concentrating. She slowly turns toward her left, towards camera. She senses something underneath her hand. Touching her hand?
